# Key Design Features
* Synthesizable, technology-independent IP Core for FPGA, ASIC and SoC
* Supplied as human readable VHDL (or Verilog) source code
* Simple FIFO input interface
* Programmable RGB channel data width (8,10,12,14-bits etc.)
* Highly versatile architecture supports direct connection to a wide range of video DACs, video encoders and DVI/HDMI transmitters
* VSYNC, HSYNC, CSYNC, DE and BLANKING outputs
* Fully programmable timing parameters
* Supports industry standard (VESA, CEA-861, ITU-R BT.656
etc.) and fully custom video modes (both progressive and
interlaced formats)
* Future-proof design supports resolutions up to 216 x 216 pixels
(8K video and above)
* Independent system and pixel clocks supporting frequencies of
400 MHz+ on basic FPGA platforms

# Applications
